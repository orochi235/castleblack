 * `clampView` are inflated by `blankPx`, the width of a floating panel: a pan
 * can pull the cells hidden under one into the open, and stops there.
 *
 * A wall smaller than the viewport on an axis cannot honor that -- the blank
 * is the viewport minus the wall, whatever the camera does -- so it gets just
 * enough inflation to sit anywhere between the two edges, which leaves the
 * fit's own top-left anchor reachable.
