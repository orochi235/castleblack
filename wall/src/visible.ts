/** Indices of the rects touching the viewport.
 *
 *  A linear scan, deliberately: it is layout-agnostic, and tens of thousands
 *  of rects cost well under a millisecond. A spatial index is what a
 *  non-uniform layout would need, not what this scale needs.
 *
 *  `viewport` may carry an origin, in the same CSS pixels as its size and
 *  measured from the canvas's own top-left. A pinch leaves only part of the
 *  canvas on screen, and that part is not at its corner; without the origin
 *  the range covers the whole canvas, which is how a pinched wall would fetch
 *  a sharper tile for every cell including the ones nobody can see. */
